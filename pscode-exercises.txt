// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

1. Create variables that can hold 1 number each - entered by user (ex int var1, int var2)
2. We should have a check in place to guard against typos (i.e. the field the user types into should only allow numbers, not words or special characters). This should block 
these values from being typed in but should not cause the program to crash.


Example: 

int var1;
int var2;
int vartotal = sum (var1)(var2);

If string in var1

Console.WriteLine($"This is not a number.");

or

if string in var2

Console.WriteLine($"This is not a number.");

else 

Console.WriteLine(total);

end if


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

1. Create an integer variable. 
2. Read the variable and check if it is even or odd
3. Print a message of either "This is an even number" or "This is an odd number."

int var1 = 0;

Console.ReadLine(var1);

If 

var1 is Odd 
Console.WriteLine("This is an odd number.");
//This will print if the number is odd.
//Ex: 1 - This is an odd number.

else

var1 is Even
Console.WriteLine("This is an even number.");
//This is will print if the number is even. 
//Ex: 2 - This is an even number.

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

array [1,2,3,4,5];

//This will display the average of the above array:
Console.WriterLine($"Average: " + Avg(array));
//Average: 3

//This will display the minimum number in the array:
Console.WriteLine($"Minimum: " + Min(array));
//Minimum: 1

//This will display the maximum number in the array:
Console.WriteLine($"Maximum: " + Max(array));
//Maximum: 5
